# Flood Risk Mapping Using GIS

## Overview
This project assesses flood risk by integrating multiple spatial factors using GIS techniques.

## Objectives
- Identify flood-prone areas  
- Create flood hazard maps  
- Support disaster risk reduction  

## Data Sources
- DEM (Digital Elevation Model)  
- River and drainage data  
- Rainfall data  

## Tools & Software
- ArcMap  
- ArcGIS Pro  

## Methodology
1. Data preparation  
2. Elevation and slope analysis  
3. Buffer and overlay analysis  
4. Flood risk zoning  

## Output
- Flood risk maps  
- Hazard zonation maps  

## Applications
- Disaster management  
- Emergency planning  
- Climate adaptation
